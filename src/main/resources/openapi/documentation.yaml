      summary: Assign linemanager to employee on sick leave
      description: |
        This endpoint can be used to assign a line manager to an employee on sick leave.
        It is not dependent on the existence of a requirement for line manager.
        
        One scenario for the use of this endpoint could be when the organizations knows that the current line manager
        will be unavailable for a period and wants to assign a replacement line manager to the employee on sick leave.
        If there already is a line manager assigned to the employee, the new line manager will overwrite the existing one.
        
        If a requirement for line manager exists for the employee, it will be marked as completed (internally and eventually in Dialogporten) when a line manager is
        assigned through this endpoint.
        
        Constraints:
        - The employee must have an active sick leave, with a grace period of 16 additional days after the end of the sick leave.
        - The employee must have an active employment in the specified organization.
        - The line manager must have an active employment in any sub organization under the parent of the specified organization.
        - The lastname provided for the employee on sick leave  must match the name registered with the provided national identification number.
        - The lastname provided for the line manager must match the name registered with the provided national identification number.

      summary: Revoke existing linemanager for employee on sick leave
      description: |
        This endpoint can be used to revoke the currently assigned line manager for an employee.
        The employee does not need to have an active sick leave.
        If the employee does have an active sick leave, using this endpoint will result in the creation of a requirement for line manager.
        
        A scenario for the use of this endpoint could be if there is an urgent need to prevent the current line manager
        from having access to the employee's sick leave information.
        This could be if the current line manager is leaving the organization and one needs to immediately revoke their access,
        without knowing who the replacement line manager will be or when they will start.
        
        Constraints:
        - The employee must have an active employment in the specified organization.
        - The lastname provided for the employee on sick leave  must match the name registered with the provided national identification number.

      description: |
        Returns a response with a list containing items with details about outstanding requirements for
        linemanager for employees on sickleave.
        
        Each item in the returned list, contains details about the requirement for line manager for an employee.
        This includes details about the employee, like the national identification number and the name.
        If there was a line manager assigned to the employee before the requirement was created,
        it also reveal the national identification number of the previous line manager and who or what caused the previous line manager to be revoked.
        This could perhaps be used to determine if the candidate the organization has on file should not be assigned
        as line manager again, and instead look for a different person to assign.
        
        Use cases for this endpoint:
        - An LPS has a subscriptions to Dialogporten and receives notifications about new requirements for line manager.
        They are concerned that they occasionally miss notifications about new requirements and want to use this
        endpoint to regularly poll for new requirements to make sure they do not miss any.
        - An LPS does not have a subscription to Dialogporten but still wants to be able to retrieve requirements for line managers.
        They can then poll this endpoint to retrieve requirements for line managers.

      Endpoints to retrieve details about requirements for line managers and for assigning line managers in order to fulfill the requirements.
      
      These endpoints are relevant when there is a requirement for line manager that needs to be fulfilled.
      "requirement" is the term we have coined for the situation when an employee on sick leave does not have a
      line manager assigned, so the employer is required to assign a line manager to the employee.
