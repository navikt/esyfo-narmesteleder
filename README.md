## Building & Running

To build or run the project, use one of the following tasks:

| Task                          | Description                                                          |
| -------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./gradlew test`              | Run the tests                                                        |
| `./gradlew build`             | Build everything                                                     |
| `buildFatJar`                 | Build an executable JAR of the server with all dependencies included |
| `buildImage`                  | Build the docker image to use with the fat JAR                       |
| `publishImageToLocalRegistry` | Publish the docker image locally                                     |
| `run`                         | Run the server                                                       |
| `runDocker`                   | Run using the local docker image                                     |

If the server starts successfully, you'll see the following output:

```
2024-12-04 14:32:45.584 [main] INFO  Application - Application started in 0.303 seconds.
2024-12-04 14:32:45.682 [main] INFO  Application - Responding at http://0.0.0.0:8080
```


## Docker compose
### Size of container platform
In order to run kafka++ you will probably need to extend the default size of your container platform. (Rancher Desktop, Colima etc.)

Suggestion for Colima
```bash
colima start --arch aarch64 --memory 8 --cpu 4 
```

We have a docker-compose.yml file to run a postgresql database, texas and a fake authserver.
In addition, we have a docker-compose.kafka.yml that will run a kafka broker, schema registry and kafka-io

Start them both using
```bash
docker-compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.kafka.yml \
  up \
  db authserver texas broker kafka-ui \
  -d
```
Stop them all again
```bash
docker-compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.kafka.yml \
  down
```
### Kafka-ui
You can use [kafka-ui](http://localhost:9000) to inspect your consumers and topics. You can also publish or read messages on the topics
